## Clean LEQ Data & Save Output Files

COPY THIS WHOLE FILE (run_this_script.qmd) TO YOUR PROJECT, THEN CHANGE VARIABLES TO RUN SCRIPT

## VARIABLES - UPDATE THESE

Press the play button on the right-hand-side **after updating the variables and copying the entire code chunk to your project** to clean and save the LEQ data in your desired output. Your input file MUST be the full Qualtrics LEQ download as a CSV for this script to work. You will need three packages to be installed for this script to run: tidyverse, janitor, and here.

```{r}
#---------------------INPUT DATA
input_var <- "data/MAPLE LEQ - Version 2023_May 11, 2023_12.34" #change this file path to match where your data is located and the file name WITHOUT the file extension. This is the data exported from the LEQ on Qualtrics as a CSV file.

#---------------------OUTPUT DATA
output_var <- "data/" #change this file path to match where your cleaned data should be saved. This is JUST the folder name, the file name will be created in the script.

#---------------------DATA TYPE FOR OUTPUT
data_type <- c("wide_detailed") #what type of data output do you want? Options are: "long", which will output a dataset with one row per ID per language per situation; "wide_summary" which will output a dataset with one row per ID and only the overall language estimates (overall, cumulative, global, current for the final situation only) and no detail for each situation; "wide_detailed" which will output a dataset with one row per ID and all information for each language and each situation in its own column. You can export multiple types by using the c() function, for example: c("long", "wide_summary")

#---------------------CHECK DOUBLE ENTRY DISCREPANCIES
check_discrepancies <- TRUE #do you want to check double entry of paper LEQ forms into Qualtrics for discrepancies? If so, change this variable to TRUE and the script will output a file called "discrepancies_to_check.csv" for specific data points to verify.

#Click the play button on the right to clean and save your data
