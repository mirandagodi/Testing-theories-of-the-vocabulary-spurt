The Welch Two Sample t-test testing the difference of exposure_percent by
lang_spurt_status (mean in group biling_dominant_spurter = 63.42, mean in group
biling_dominant_nonspurter = 56.41) suggests that the effect is positive, statistically
significant, and large (difference = 7.01, 95% CI [0.42, 13.60], t(25.05) = 2.19, p =
0.038; Cohen's d = 0.88, 95% CI [0.05, 1.69])
