The Welch Two Sample t-test testing the difference of exposure_percent by
lang_spurt_status (mean in group biling_nondominant_spurter = 36.60, mean in group
biling_nondominant_nonspurter = 38.53) suggests that the effect is negative, statistically
not significant, and small (difference = -1.93, 95% CI [-9.44, 5.58], t(25.01) = -0.53, p
= 0.602; Cohen's d = -0.21, 95% CI [-1.00, 0.58])
