"1","We fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using REML and nloptwrap optimizer) to predict words_learned with exposure_percent (formula: words_learned ~
exposure_percent). The model included study_id as random effect (formula: ~1 | study_id). The model's total explanatory power is substantial (conditional R2 =
0.32) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.12. The model's intercept, corresponding to exposure_percent = 0, is at 26.98 (95%
CI [7.42, 46.54], t(44) = 2.78, p = 0.008). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure percent is statistically significant and positive (beta = 0.35, 95% CI [0.08, 0.63], t(44) = 2.57, p = 0.014; Std. beta = 0.35, 95% CI
[0.08, 0.62])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed
using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
