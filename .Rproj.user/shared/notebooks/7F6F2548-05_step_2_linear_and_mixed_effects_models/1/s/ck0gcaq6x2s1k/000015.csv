"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict words_learned with exposure_balance (formula: words_learned ~ exposure_balance). The model explains a
statistically not significant and weak proportion of variance (R2 = 0.08, F(1, 30) = 2.61, p = 0.116, adj. R2 = 0.05). The model's intercept, corresponding to
exposure_balance = 0, is at 63.44 (95% CI [42.59, 84.30], t(30) = 6.21, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure balance is statistically non-significant and positive (beta = 0.55, 95% CI [-0.15, 1.25], t(30) = 1.62, p = 0.116; Std. beta = 0.28,
95% CI [-0.07, 0.64])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed
using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
