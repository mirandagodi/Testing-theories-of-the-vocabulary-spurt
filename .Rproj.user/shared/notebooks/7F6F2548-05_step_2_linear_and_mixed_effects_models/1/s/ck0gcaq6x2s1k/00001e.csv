"1","We fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using REML and nloptwrap optimizer) to predict
words_learned with exposure_percent (formula: words_learned ~ exposure_percent). The model
included study_id as random effect (formula: ~1 | study_id). The model's total explanatory
power is substantial (conditional R2 = 0.37) and the part related to the fixed effects
alone (marginal R2) is of 0.15. The model's intercept, corresponding to exposure_percent =
0, is at 24.13 (95% CI [3.65, 44.61], t(45) = 2.37, p = 0.022). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure percent is statistically significant and positive (beta = 0.42,
95% CI [0.13, 0.70], t(45) = 2.93, p = 0.005; Std. beta = 0.39, 95% CI [0.12, 0.65])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of
the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald
t-distribution approximation.
