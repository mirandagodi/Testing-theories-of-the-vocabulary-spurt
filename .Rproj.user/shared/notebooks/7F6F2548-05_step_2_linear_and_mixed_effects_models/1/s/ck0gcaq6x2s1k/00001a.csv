"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict words_learned with exposure_balance (formula: words_learned ~ exposure_balance). The model explains a
statistically not significant and weak proportion of variance (R2 = 0.06, F(1, 32) = 2.02, p = 0.165, adj. R2 = 0.03). The model's intercept, corresponding to
exposure_balance = 0, is at 63.45 (95% CI [48.88, 78.02], t(32) = 8.87, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure balance is statistically non-significant and negative (beta = -0.33, 95% CI [-0.81, 0.14], t(32) = -1.42, p = 0.165; Std. beta =
-0.24, 95% CI [-0.59, 0.11])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed
using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
