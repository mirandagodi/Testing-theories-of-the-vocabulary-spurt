"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict words_learned with
exposure_balance (formula: words_learned ~ exposure_balance). The model explains a
statistically not significant and weak proportion of variance (R2 = 0.06, F(1, 32) = 1.87,
p = 0.181, adj. R2 = 0.03). The model's intercept, corresponding to exposure_balance = 0,
is at 66.40 (95% CI [51.95, 80.86], t(32) = 9.36, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure balance is statistically non-significant and negative (beta =
-0.33, 95% CI [-0.82, 0.16], t(32) = -1.37, p = 0.181; Std. beta = -0.24, 95% CI [-0.59,
0.11])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of
the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald
t-distribution approximation.
