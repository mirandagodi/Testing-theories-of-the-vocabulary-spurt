"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict words_learned with
exposure_balance (formula: words_learned ~ exposure_balance). The model explains a
statistically not significant and weak proportion of variance (R2 = 0.05, F(1, 31) = 1.76,
p = 0.194, adj. R2 = 0.02). The model's intercept, corresponding to exposure_balance = 0,
is at 67.37 (95% CI [46.85, 87.89], t(31) = 6.70, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure balance is statistically non-significant and positive (beta =
0.46, 95% CI [-0.24, 1.15], t(31) = 1.33, p = 0.194; Std. beta = 0.23, 95% CI [-0.12,
0.59])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of
the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald
t-distribution approximation.
