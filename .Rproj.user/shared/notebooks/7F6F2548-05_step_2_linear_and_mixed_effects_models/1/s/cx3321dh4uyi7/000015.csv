"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict slope with exposure_balance (formula: slope ~ exposure_balance). The model explains a statistically
significant and moderate proportion of variance (R2 = 0.17, F(1, 32) = 6.62, p = 0.015, adj. R2 = 0.15). The model's intercept, corresponding to
exposure_balance = 0, is at 10.54 (95% CI [9.27, 11.81], t(32) = 16.88, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure balance is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.05, 95% CI [-0.09, -0.01], t(32) = -2.57, p = 0.015; Std. beta = -0.41,
95% CI [-0.74, -0.09])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed
using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
