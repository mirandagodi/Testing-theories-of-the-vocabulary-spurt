"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict midpoint with exposure_balance (formula: midpoint ~ exposure_balance). The model explains a
statistically not significant and weak proportion of variance (R2 = 0.10, F(1, 32) = 3.72, p = 0.063, adj. R2 = 0.08). The model's intercept, corresponding to
exposure_balance = 0, is at 22.91 (95% CI [21.29, 24.52], t(32) = 28.87, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure balance is statistically non-significant and positive (beta = 0.05, 95% CI [-2.79e-03, 0.10], t(32) = 1.93, p = 0.063; Std. beta =
0.32, 95% CI [-0.02, 0.66])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed
using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
