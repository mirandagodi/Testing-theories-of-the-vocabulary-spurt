"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict midpoint with exposure_balance
(formula: midpoint ~ exposure_balance). The model explains a statistically not significant
and weak proportion of variance (R2 = 0.08, F(1, 32) = 2.75, p = 0.107, adj. R2 = 0.05).
The model's intercept, corresponding to exposure_balance = 0, is at 22.95 (95% CI [21.44,
24.46], t(32) = 30.98, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure balance is statistically non-significant and positive (beta =
0.04, 95% CI [-9.53e-03, 0.09], t(32) = 1.66, p = 0.107; Std. beta = 0.28, 95% CI [-0.06,
0.63])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of
the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald
t-distribution approximation.
