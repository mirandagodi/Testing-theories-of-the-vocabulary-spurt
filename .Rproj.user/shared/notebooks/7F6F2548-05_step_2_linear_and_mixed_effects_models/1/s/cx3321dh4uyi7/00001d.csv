"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict slope with exposure_balance
(formula: slope ~ exposure_balance). The model explains a statistically significant and
moderate proportion of variance (R2 = 0.16, F(1, 32) = 6.26, p = 0.018, adj. R2 = 0.14).
The model's intercept, corresponding to exposure_balance = 0, is at 11.36 (95% CI [9.67,
13.05], t(32) = 13.68, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure balance is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.07,
95% CI [-0.13, -0.01], t(32) = -2.50, p = 0.018; Std. beta = -0.40, 95% CI [-0.73, -0.08])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of
the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald
t-distribution approximation.
