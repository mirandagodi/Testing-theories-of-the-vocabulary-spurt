"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict midpoint with exposure_balance (formula: midpoint ~ exposure_balance). The model explains a
statistically significant and moderate proportion of variance (R2 = 0.19, F(1, 30) = 6.93, p = 0.013, adj. R2 = 0.16). The model's intercept, corresponding to
exposure_balance = 0, is at 22.91 (95% CI [21.35, 24.47], t(30) = 29.97, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure balance is statistically significant and positive (beta = 0.07, 95% CI [0.02, 0.12], t(30) = 2.63, p = 0.013; Std. beta = 0.43, 95% CI
[0.10, 0.77])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed
using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
