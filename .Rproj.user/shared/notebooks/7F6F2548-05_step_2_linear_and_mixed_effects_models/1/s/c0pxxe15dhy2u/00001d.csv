"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict slope with exposure_balance
(formula: slope ~ exposure_balance). The model explains a statistically significant and
moderate proportion of variance (R2 = 0.20, F(1, 31) = 7.77, p = 0.009, adj. R2 = 0.17).
The model's intercept, corresponding to exposure_balance = 0, is at 11.41 (95% CI [9.73,
13.08], t(31) = 13.87, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure balance is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.08,
95% CI [-0.14, -0.02], t(31) = -2.79, p = 0.009; Std. beta = -0.45, 95% CI [-0.78, -0.12])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of
the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald
t-distribution approximation.
