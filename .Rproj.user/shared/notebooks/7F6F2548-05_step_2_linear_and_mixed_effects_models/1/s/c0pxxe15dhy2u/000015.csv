"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict slope with exposure_balance (formula: slope ~ exposure_balance). The model explains a statistically
significant and moderate proportion of variance (R2 = 0.20, F(1, 30) = 7.55, p = 0.010, adj. R2 = 0.17). The model's intercept, corresponding to
exposure_balance = 0, is at 10.54 (95% CI [9.29, 11.79], t(30) = 17.28, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure balance is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.06, 95% CI [-0.10, -0.01], t(30) = -2.75, p = 0.010; Std. beta = -0.45,
95% CI [-0.78, -0.12])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed
using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
