"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict midpoint with exposure_balance
(formula: midpoint ~ exposure_balance). The model explains a statistically significant and
moderate proportion of variance (R2 = 0.20, F(1, 31) = 7.76, p = 0.009, adj. R2 = 0.17).
The model's intercept, corresponding to exposure_balance = 0, is at 22.85 (95% CI [21.36,
24.33], t(31) = 31.40, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure balance is statistically significant and positive (beta = 0.07,
95% CI [0.02, 0.12], t(31) = 2.79, p = 0.009; Std. beta = 0.45, 95% CI [0.12, 0.78])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of
the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald
t-distribution approximation.
