"1","We fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using REML and nloptwrap optimizer) to predict
slope with exposure_percent (formula: slope ~ exposure_percent). The model included
study_id as random effect (formula: ~1 | study_id). The model's total explanatory power is
substantial (conditional R2 = 0.33) and the part related to the fixed effects alone
(marginal R2) is of 0.05. The model's intercept, corresponding to exposure_percent = 0, is
at 8.01 (95% CI [5.48, 10.54], t(45) = 6.38, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure percent is statistically non-significant and positive (beta =
0.03, 95% CI [-7.86e-03, 0.06], t(45) = 1.56, p = 0.125; Std. beta = 0.22, 95% CI [-0.06,
0.50])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of
the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald
t-distribution approximation.
