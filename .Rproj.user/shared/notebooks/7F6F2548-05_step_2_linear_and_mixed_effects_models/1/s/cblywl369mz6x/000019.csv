"1","We fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using REML and nloptwrap optimizer) to predict
midpoint with exposure_percent (formula: midpoint ~ exposure_percent). The model included
study_id as random effect (formula: ~1 | study_id). The model's total explanatory power is
substantial (conditional R2 = 0.35) and the part related to the fixed effects alone
(marginal R2) is of 0.08. The model's intercept, corresponding to exposure_percent = 0, is
at 26.19 (95% CI [24.15, 28.22], t(45) = 25.93, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure percent is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.03,
95% CI [-0.06, -1.90e-03], t(45) = -2.15, p = 0.037; Std. beta = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.57,
-0.02])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of
the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald
t-distribution approximation.
