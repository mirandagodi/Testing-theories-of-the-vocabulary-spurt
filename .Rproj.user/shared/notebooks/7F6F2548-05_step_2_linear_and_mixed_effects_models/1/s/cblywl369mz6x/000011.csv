"1","We fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using REML and nloptwrap optimizer) to predict midpoint with exposure_percent (formula: midpoint ~ exposure_percent).
The model included study_id as random effect (formula: ~1 | study_id). The model's total explanatory power is substantial (conditional R2 = 0.35) and the part
related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.08. The model's intercept, corresponding to exposure_percent = 0, is at 26.14 (95% CI [24.08, 28.21],
t(44) = 25.51, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of exposure percent is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.03, 95% CI [-0.06, -1.59e-04], t(44) = -2.03, p = 0.049; Std. beta =
-0.28, 95% CI [-0.56, -1.53e-03])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed
using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
